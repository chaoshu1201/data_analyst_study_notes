# Descriptive Statistics I

**Four main aspects for quantitive data analysis**
1. Centre
2. Spread
3. Shape
4. Outlies

## Measures of Centre
**Three widely accepted measures of centres**
1. **Mean**

2. **Median** \
The median is a value that divides our data set such that 50% of the values are larger while the remaining 50% are smaller. \
 **_Calculation_**
 * Sort the values first
 * Odd number of observations \
 Median = the number in the direct middle
 * Even number of observations \
 Median = the average of the two values in the middle
 
 Whether the mean or median will be used to describe a dataset is largely dependent on the shape of our dataset and if there are any outliers.

3. **Mode** \
The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset. There might be multiple modes for a particular dataset, or no mode at all.
 * If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode
 * If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more than one mode.
